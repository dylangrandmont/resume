        <p>
          Give me a problem and I will create software to solve it; Give me colleagues and I will help build an
          effective and collaborative team to solve it at scale.
          I enjoy crafting quality software and positive team cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like working with Scrum and Agile, but mostly I like delivering valuable and impactful experiences to users.
          Authentic people and big learning curves motivate me.
          I've been solving complex problems across disciplines and across timezones for 10+ years professionally.

        <h3>Geological Visualization on the Web</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#seequent-lead-dev">At Seequent</a>, my team developed a web visualization tool which allowed Earth
          Scientists to share their surface modelling with their team or with the world.
          Please, click below to explore for yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
          Together we took a legacy demo application based in WebGL and turned it into a production web application for
          the company.
          This included a database and REST API migration in Google Cloud infrastructure.
          My biggest contributions to the project included development of collaboration features to capture "slides" and
          "feedback" on modelling results.
          I also lead the effort to implement our Design Team's vision for the product.
          Together we took a Design System and implemented it on the web using React components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our users really ran with the concept and created impactful presentations.

            Italian government used the technology</a> to publish their Geological and Seismic models for greater
          transparency with the public.
          Meanwhile mining companies like <a href="https://www.pantoro.com.au/projects/3d-models/ok-mine/">Pantoro
            created public visualizations of their prospects for investors.</a>

          I am a major cartography nerd.
          After my time at Shell, I developed a web application based on the Google Maps API to display natural resource
          extraction data from Western Canada.

          The project pulled drilling information from the four Western Canadian provinces using provincial APIs and web
          crawling.

        <h3>Drilling Automation Using Seismic Data</h3>

            style="float: right; padding-left: 24px; padding-bottom: 12px; max-width: 400px;">
          At Shell I created a Python application to automate an existing manual workflow in the operations teams.
          This software integrated seismic surfaces in the subsurface along with drilling data within a field and
          produced a high-accuracy surface used for horizontal drilling.
          This software was used by the operation teams to land many multi-million dollar natural gas wells.
